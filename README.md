**Excited to share Churn Analysis Project using SQL Server, Power BI, and Machine Learning.**

This project demonstrates a complete workflow from data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) to data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling, offering significant insights and strategies for enhancing customer retention.

In this complete CHURN ANALYSIS project, we will cover a wide range of insights which includes:
1. ETL process in SQL Server
2. Data Cleaning in SQL Server
3. Power BI Transformations
4. Power BI Visualization & Enhancing Visuals
5. Build Machine Learning Model - Random Forest
6. Visualize Predicted Data in Power BI

**Situation**:
- Competitive business environment necessitates effective customer retention strategies.
- Churn analysis helps understand and reduce customer attrition by examining patterns and reasons for customer departures.

**Task**:
- Develop a comprehensive Power BI dashboard utilizing customer data.
- Objectives:
  - Visualize and analyze customer data at various levels (demographic, geographic, payment, account info, services).
  - Study churner profiles to identify areas for marketing campaigns.
  - Predict future churners using a machine learning model.
  - Create metrics such as total customers, total churn, churn rate, and new joiners.

**Action**:
- **ETL Process in SQL Server**:
  - Loaded data from source files into SQL Server for better data handling and integrity.
  - Cleaned and prepared data for analysis.
- **Data Transformation in Power BI**:
  - Transformed data for better visualization and analysis.
- **Power BI Visualization**:
  - Created and enhanced visuals to represent customer data effectively.
  - Visualized customer data at various levels including demographic, geographic, payment, and services.
- **Churn Prediction Model â€“ Random Forest**:
  - Developed a Random Forest model to predict customer churn.
  - Trained and validated the model using customer data.
- **Integration and Dashboard Creation**:
  - Imported the predicted data back into SQL Server.
  - Connected the data to Power BI.
  - Created a comprehensive Power BI dashboard with:
    - An executive summary for analyzing historical data.
    - A prediction page for forecasting future churners.

**Result**:
- Created a detailed Power BI dashboard that visualizes and analyzes customer data.
- Implemented a churn prediction model with Random Forest.
- Enabled proactive steps to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.
- Provided actionable insights for targeted marketing campaigns to reduce customer churn.
- Improved ability to predict and understand customer behavior.
- Developed a valuable tool for customer retention and business growth.
